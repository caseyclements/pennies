    This is vector root finding problem to find N discount rates of curve nodes
    from M market contract prices. We form a Jacobian from the sensitivities of
    contract Present Values to curve rates.

    To create a coherent market model, we need to provide:
    -1. Valuation Date: dt_valuation
    -2. Market Prices: N contracts with par rates.
        - Present Value of each contract == 0
        - The vector of PV's forms the objective function in the calibration.
    -3. A Market Model, asset of curves and fx rates that price the market
        - RatesTermStructure with the following:
         C currencies
         C 'discount' curves
         B ibor curves
         C-1 fx rates
         M Curves:
         - M == C + B == N
         - For each curve..
           - m_i node dates, and guesses for (pseudo-)zero rates
           - An interpolator, providing rates given dates or year fractions
             - This also gives the sensitivity of an arbitrary point in time,
             - given a move of one of the nodes (a vector of length m_i)
             - See market.interpolate

    scipy.optimize.root is used to find the solution. It requires two inputs:

    1. fun. PV(x). Vector of length N
    2. x0 = rates, of length N.  This is all rates in the curves_to_calibrate
        x0 is the initial guess.

    And takes a number of optimal arguments.

    3. args. Additional arguments to fun and jac, beyond x
    4. jac. We produce a semi-analytic Jacobian, an (N x M) matrix,
        for Piecewise -Linear and -CubicTakes interpolators.
    5. Addl kwargs: method='hybr', tol=None, callback=None, options=None
        These are described in scipy.optimize.root docs

    Parameters
    ----------
    rates_mkt: RatesTermStructure
        Market model to calibrate, with initial guesses for par rates.
        For rates, the structure is a set of funding and forward curves,
        along with fx rates, if multiple currencies are required.
    target_portfolio: Portfolio
        The Target portfolio is a representation of all the instruments that
        one wishes to calibrate the curves to.
        These are not actual trades. They provide standard contracts and prices.
    rates_guess: array, optional
        Guess for discount rates. Either a 1D numpy array or a scalar.
        If an array length must be equal to sum of all nodes in curves.
    root_kwargs: dictionary, optional
        Keyword Args to be passed to scipy.optimize.root. eg method, options

    The first test is define N swaps and compute a single curve of N nodes.

    If N = 1, we could, in theory, compute a flat curve of ConstantRate.
    If N = 2, we could, in theory, define 2 constant curves: 1 funding, 1 ibor
    If N >= 3, we could compute 1 curve by piecewise linear
